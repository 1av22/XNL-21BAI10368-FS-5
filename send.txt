Prioritized Task List (Focus on Core Requirements)

Given the limited time, we'll focus on the most crucial tasks to get a functional, albeit not fully polished, application.

Phase 1: Authentication and Authorization Improvements (Critical)

    Task 1: Implement Token Refresh (Frontend & Backend)
        Priority: High (Essential for user experience)
        Reason: Prevents frequent logouts, a core functionality issue.
        Backend (src/routers/users.py, src/utils.py):
            Implement a /refresh-token endpoint.
            This endpoint should take a valid refresh token (you'll need to generate and store these) and issue a new access token.
            Modify create_access_token to also create refresh tokens. Consider storing these in the database, associated with the user.
            Modify decode_access_token to have different logic for access and refresh tokens.
        Frontend (src/App.jsx, src/pages/LoginPage.jsx, src/components/Navbar.jsx, potentially a new auth utility file):
            Modify handleLogin in App.jsx to store both access and refresh tokens.
            Implement a function to check for token expiration.
            Use Axios interceptors to:
                Include the access token in the Authorization header for all requests.
                Handle 401 (Unauthorized) errors:
                    If the access token is expired, use the refresh token to get a new access token.
                    Update the access token in local storage.
                    Retry the original request.
                    If the refresh token is also expired or invalid, redirect the user to the login page.
            Modify Navbar.jsx to dispatch token refresh logic.

    Task 2: Axios Interceptors (Frontend)
        Priority: High (Improves code maintainability and reduces redundancy)
        Reason: Simplifies API calls and centralizes authorization header management.
        Frontend (A new src/utils/axiosInstance.js or similar):
            Create an Axios instance.
            Implement request and response interceptors as described in Task 1.
            Use this Axios instance for all API calls in your components.

Phase 2: Chat Enhancements (High)

    Task 3: Implement Chat Rooms (Backend & Frontend)
        Priority: High (Addresses a core functionality gap)
        Reason: The current chat is not really usable without rooms.
        Backend (src/routers/chat.py):
            Modify the WebSocket endpoint to accept a room_id.
            Update active_connections and ephemeral_messages to manage connections and messages per room (e.g., active_connections: dict[str, dict[str, list[WebSocket]]] = {} where the first key is the room id and the second key is the client id).
            Modify the logic to send and receive messages within a specific room.
            Consider how you will create and manage these room IDs (e.g., video ID as room ID, or separate room creation). For now, you can use a video id as the room id.
        Frontend (src/pages/ChatPage.jsx):
            Modify ChatPage.jsx to accept a room_id (e.g., from the video page or a room selection interface). You can use useParams from react-router-dom.
            Update the WebSocket connection URL to include the room_id.
            Test sending and receiving messages in different rooms.

    Task 4: Chat Message Persistence (Backend - Optional, but Recommended)
        Priority: Medium (Enhances the chat feature)
        Reason: Saving messages provides history and a better user experience.
        Backend (src/routers/chat.py, src/models.py, database modifications):
            Modify the Message model in src/models.py to include room_id.
            When a message is received via WebSocket, save it to the database.
            When a user joins a chat room, fetch the message history for that room and send it to the user.

Phase 3: Video Functionality (If Time Permits)

    Task 5: Fix Sentiment Analysis (Backend)
        Priority: Medium (Corrects a bug)
        Reason: Sentiment analysis is currently broken.
        Backend (src/routers/videos.py, src/services.py):
            Modify the upload_video function in src/routers/videos.py to correctly extract the text to be analyzed. This might involve:
                If you are planning to analyze the video, you will need to extract text from the video. This is complex and might not be achievable in the time remaining.
                A simpler approach would be to analyze the video title or, even better, a description provided by the user during upload. You will need to add a field in the frontend for the user to add a description.
            Pass the correct text to the analyze_sentiment function in src/services.py.

    Task 6: Implement Video Description (Frontend & Backend)
        Priority: Medium (Needed for Task 5)
        Reason: To allow users to add a description for sentiment analysis.
        Backend (src/models.py, src/routers/videos.py, database modifications):
            Add a description field to the Video model in src/models.py.
            Modify the /upload endpoint in src/routers/videos.py to accept and store the video description. You will need to modify the database table as well.
        Frontend (src/pages/UploadPage.jsx):
            Add an input field for the video description in UploadPage.jsx.
            Include the description in the FormData when uploading the video.

Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (If Time Permits)

    Task 7: Basic Testing
        Priority: Medium (Improves reliability)
        Reason: To catch major errors.
        Frontend & Backend:
            Test the core functionality:
                User registration and login.
                Video upload and display.
                Real-time chat in rooms.
            Focus on manual testing given the time constraints.

    Task 8: Code Cleanup and UI Improvements
        Priority: Low (Polishes the application)
        Reason: To improve the look and feel.
        Frontend:
            Address any obvious UI issues.
            Improve styling where possible.

Important Considerations:

    Time Management: Stick to the priorities. If you're running out of time, skip the lower-priority tasks.
    Clear Code: I will provide clear code snippets and explanations to help you implement the changes.
    Focus on Functionality: Prioritize getting the core features working over making it look perfect.
    Sleep: Get some rest! Working while exhausted leads to mistakes. Even a short break will help you focus.
